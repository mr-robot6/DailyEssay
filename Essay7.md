Day 10

Friday or turf day, we reached the office by 9 and I started working on my figma e-commerce app. I learned about using components and different ways to do a prototype connection. Components are elements that can be reused in multiple designs. They aid in the creation and management of uniform designs across multiple projects.

Components can be made from any layers or objects you've created. These could include a variety of items such as buttons, icons, layouts, and more. I had many extra features in mind but I'm hesitant to implement it because the extra features bring in more complications during the next process. I looked in to some basics of flutter programming and learned about some fundamentals of dart programming like stateful vs stateless widgets. The State is the information that can be read synchronously when the widget is created and that may change over time.

Stateless Widget: Stateless widgets are widgets that can't be changed once they've been built. Once developed, these widgets are immutable, which means that any changes to the variables, icons, buttons, or data retrieval will not affect the app's state.

Stateful Widgets are widgets that can have their state changed after they've been created. These states are mutable, meaning they can change multiple times throughout their lives. This basically means that an app's state might change several times depending on the variables, inputs, and data used. I also learned about constructors in classes, Constructor is a special method of Dart class which is automatically called when the object is created. The constructor is like a function with/without parameters but it doesn’t have a return type. Then I saw the difference between final, const and var in flutter. In Dart, the Const keyword works in the same way as the final keyword. The only distinction between final and const is that const makes the variable constant only at compilation time. When you use const on an object, the object's whole deep state is rigidly fixed at compilation time, and the object is deemed frozen and entirely immutable.

The first session was about html, the session started with the introduction to linking an external css file to a html using the link command. Then we were taught about span tag, The <span> tag is an inline container for marking up a section of text or a document, but unlike the div tag <span> is an inline element. After that we had a session by Askin, continuing from the previous session of taking up your own responsibility and not treating your job or tasks as an obligation, by doing this, we can work efficiently and be more relaxed. The word for today was Obsession, a notion or thought that occupies or intrudes on a person's mind on a regular basis can be termed as Obsession, It's like an extreme sort of interest that motivates one to learn more about a subject and strive to be the best at it. Since i’ve already developed an interest towards this company and what i'm doing now, i think it will be easy for me to develop an obsession towards this. The following session was centred on algorithms, which we were told to think about and perform in front of the class. We performed our task, which involved two people arm wrestling and a guy throwing darts dependent on the outcome of the arm wrestling. This was done to make one understand about the multitude of steps necessary to perform a simple task like walking up to a table. Before executing or beginning to code, it is critical to look at the many step-by-step methods; taking notes or comprehending what we are about to accomplish is what makes a competent coder or developer. 

The next session was a really interesting one, where Mr Anoop explained about the basics of presenting something, He explained about the time he had to present or explain the contents of a book, he broke down what he did to execute that presentation. It started with understanding what you know about the topic, next one was understanding the audience, framing your story in a way that is relatable for the audience is what makes a good presentation. We all know that humans are wired to listen to stories, and metaphors abound for the narrative structures that work best to engage people. When I think about compelling presentations, I think about taking an audience on a journey. A successful talk is a little miracle—people see the world differently afterward, he added. After getting down the framework, the next step is the delivery, which has to be interactive and vibrant, an interactive presentation makes the talk a memorable one.
