Day 11

Monday,

Usual mornings as i progressed my app design in figma, i learned that it is better to make a seller app along with the consumer app, the seller app will be the place where the seller or the vendor can add, remove or edit his/her inventory, the seller app can also contain information regarding his sales. The app lets you Save time with quick and easy access to sales, listings, and other store features, Manage inventory and product prices remotely, Improve store performance by keeping up with customer reviews and requests. 

I also learned how to look at flutter programming. Every app is made up of widgets, each widget has a row or column which has a child. The layout is called scaffold on which the rows and columns are placed, every app has an appbar on the top and the rest of the app is build beneath it, the body can be contained in a container widget, The container in Flutter is a parent widget that can contain multiple child widgets and manage them efficiently through width, height, padding, background color, etc. It is a widget that combines common painting, positioning, and sizing of the child widgets.

I also learned about border-box in html. To avoid the width or height getting increased or decreased when using CSS properties like margin, padding, etc, we can use the CSS property called box-sizing and set its value to border-box on the element in CSS. 

After that i got several tasks to complete this week along with the app presentation and book report. The session started around 2 pm, where we were introduced to data, data is simply information regarding anything, everything, living or non living has data, data can be many types like numbers, texts or boolean. Data can be in the form of videos or pictures or even sound. There are multiple ways to store data, it depends on what type of data is provided, mp4 and jpeg files can stores in local drives or in cloud storage while physical notes and pictures can be stores in lockers, shelves etc. Next, we were taught about operators, the two types of operators are arithmetic and boolean operators. 

The arithmetic operators perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulus operations. It can also include ‘=’ assigning operator, which can be used to assign a value to a variable, ‘++’ incrementing operator, which add one to the value and ‘--’ decrementing operator, which reduced one from the value. 

Boolean operators are operators like <, >, ==, etc these operators are used for comparison, these operators allows us to compare between 2 or more values in a way the machine can also understand. ‘==’ is the equal to operator, > is the greater than operator, < is the less than operator, <= is the less than or equal to operator, >= is the greater than or equal to operator, != is the not equal to operator, && is the AND operator and || is the OR operator.
