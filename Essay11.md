say- day 14

As we delve further into the fundamentals of programming, we pick up on a variety of new skills. The problem-solving lesson may be used in our daily lives and can produce amazing results if done correctly. It is so important that it can inspire you to conceive solutions to problems that no one else has considered; I believe this is why talented developers and programmers are able to tackle real-world problems more efficiently and effectively.

Today was a really happening day. There were 2 sessions along with that i was working on my app, adding the seller app and beginning the admin app. I started writing the report on MVVM architecture, the architecture concept is pretty easy but the implementation is difficult compared to some others but there are advantages for using this architecture 

    MVVM allows for easier concurrent development of a user interface and the components that power it.


    Because MVVM encapsulates the View, the amount of business logic (or glue) required in the code underneath it is reduced.


    It may be easier to unit test ViewModel code than it is to unit test event-driven code.


    The ViewModel (which is more like a Model than a View) may be tested without having to worry about UI automation or interaction.



The first session was a continuation of Abraham anna's "Data Session," in which he delved more into the idea that "programming is for humans." He also invited us to consider a philosophical topic, "How do we separate living and nonliving," which he requested us to consider yesterday. He went over what constitutes a talented programmer, explaining that while some people are naturally gifted at coding, leveraging that knowledge to build anything is the next step for any programmer or developer. What we have been doing in the past is simply memorising everything in order to learn it; this simply increases your memory; now we must think; the human brain is something we don't fully understand; each person's problem-solving and analytical thinking abilities are unique, and these are the main factors required for programming. A programming language, like any other, is designed to allow several individuals with different ideas to collaborate on a single canvas to create something. The language just allows another person to grasp one's programming style. 

The session was by Koushik, the session started with introduction to English, where we discussed how the language is taught to us and how it is laid out. First, he showed us several paragraphs which consisted of something different than the usual, for eg: in the first one the paragraph looked normal but the letters of each word were jumbled except the first and the last, but we still could read the entire para because our brains are conditioned like that,  our brains don't just rely on what they see - they also rely on what we expect to see.  

Then we broke down the english language, which consisted of symbols, tokens- which is a collection of symbols, then expressions- which is a collection of tokens, then came grammar, which is just a set of arrangements required to create meaning out of a sentence. 

Moving on to a programming language, he told that “computers are dumb”, the different methods requred to make sense in any language are 

    Lexical analysis

Lexical analysis means grouping a stream of letters or sounds into sets of units that represent meaningful syntax. In linguistics, it is called parsing, and in computer science, it can be called parsing or tokenizing.

    Semantic analysis

Which is basically a meaning check 

      

So we look for symbols, tokens and sp characters then we look whether they are arranged properly before we understand it. 

These same processes collectively are called compilation, Compiling refers to the act of converting programs written in high level programming language, which is understandable and written by humans, into a low level binary language understood only by the computer and errors during compilation is termed as compile time error. 

So just like how we broke down the english language if we do the same with a programming language, it will be like this

The symbols will be Unicode - The Unicode Standard provides a unique number for every character, no matter what platform, device, application or language. It has been adopted by all modern software providers and now allows data to be transported through many different platforms, devices and applications without corruption. Support of Unicode forms the foundation for the representation of languages and symbols in all major operating systems, search engines, browsers, laptops, and smartphones

Tokens include Punctuator, Identifier Name, Numerical value, String literal, operator, keywords

We were also told to make up a language of our own, with rules and syntax of our own for monday, the session ended with the saying that ‘Programming is just one way of solving problems’
