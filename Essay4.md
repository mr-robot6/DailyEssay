## Tuesday




Today marks the 6th day of our internship, as usual we reached by 9 and i began with learning app designing in figma, i started working on the idea of a marketplace for small scale and small businesses. I learned from several pre-made apps like amazon and myntra to get a basic idea of what a layout should look like. Also from the book that my mentor gave me i got some of the most important rules and descriptions that must be followed while designing an app. With reference to the previous paper sketches i have made i already had an idea of how the ui should look like. I was told to design the figma layout first, since I'm new to coding, I have also started learning flutter basics like importing material dart files etc. I also learned about the pub.dev library where all the flutter libraries are available. Furthermore, I was introduced to Firebase, which is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. Firebase provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, creating marketing and product experiments.
Firebase offers a number of services, including:
1.Analytics – Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting on as many as 500 separate events. Analytics presents data about user behavior in iOS and Android apps, enabling better decision-making about improving performance and app marketing.
2.Authentication – Firebase Authentication makes it easy for developers to build secure authentication systems and enhances the sign-in and onboarding experience for users. This feature offers a complete identity solution, supporting email and password accounts, phone auth, as well as Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter login and more.
3.Cloud messaging – Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging tool that lets companies reliably receive and deliver messages on iOS, Android and the web at no cost.
4.Realtime database – the Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that enables data to be stored and synced between users in real time. The data is synced across all clients in real time and is still available when an app goes offline.
5.Crashlytics – Firebase Crashlytics is a real-time crash reporter that helps developers track, prioritize and fix stability issues that reduce the quality of their apps. With crashlytics, developers spend less time organizing and troubleshooting crashes and more time building features for their apps.
6.Performance – Firebase Performance Monitoring service gives developers insight into the performance characteristics of their iOS and Android apps to help them determine where and when the performance of their apps can be improved.
7.Test lab – Firebase Test Lab is a cloud-based app-testing infrastructure. With one operation, developers can test their iOS or Android apps across a variety of devices and device configurations. They can see the results, including videos, screenshots and logs, in the Firebase console.
I had many ideas which I wanted to implement in to the app, but since I'm a novice I'll stick to the basic things first and then move on from there. Then we had a session on Prepositional statements, A preposition is a definition sentence which is true or false but not both. Many propositions are composite that are composed of subpropositions and various connectives discussed subsequently. Such a composite proposition is said to be compound propositions. A proposition is called primitive if it cannot be broken down into the simpler proposition that is if it is not composite. Some types of prepositional statements include True/False, Exclamatory, Interrogative, Order/Command.
Propositional logic can be used to find out whether a statement could be false or true with respect to other statements. For example:
The sun makes things warmer,
My car is parked outside, under the sun.
My car is getting warmer
here. The 3rd statement is dependent upon whether the second statement is T/F, the first statement is a universal truth and it can never be false.
The Three basic logical operations conjunction, disjunction, and negation which correspond respectively. To the English words "and", "or" and "not".
Conjunction (p ^ q):
Any two propositions can be combined by the word and to form a compound proposition said to be the conjunction of the original proposition. Symbolically p ^ q reads p and q denotes the conjunction of p and q. Since, p ^ q is a proposition it has the truth value and this truth value depends only on the truth values of p and q, specifically:
If p and q are true then p ^ q is true otherwise p ^ q is false.
Disjunction (p V q)
Any two propositions can be combined by the word "or" to form a compound proposition that is said to be the disjunction of the original proposition, symbolically p V q.
Read "p or q" denotes the disjunction of p and q. The truth value of p V q depends only on the truth values of p and q as follow:
Definition: If p and q are false then p V q is false, otherwise p V q is true.0
Negation( ~p)
Given any proposition p another proposition is said to be the negation of p can be formed by writing - it is not the case that... or "it is false that ...", before p or if possible by inserting in p the word "not" symbolically. ~p or ~p.
Read "not p", denotes the negation of p. The truth value of p depends on the truth value of p as follows:
Definition: If p is true then ~p is false and if p is false then ~p is true.

After that we had a session on HTML or HyperText Markup Language, which is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
We used the linux terminal and vim to execute a .html file and edit the file using CSS. With commands like  HREF, The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. We also used CSS to modify the site using commands like, background-color, font-size, style type etc. A task was given at the end to create a login page with HTML and CSS.
