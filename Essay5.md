# Essay
## Wednesday



today, 30th of March marks 1 week of my internship. Today started like usual at around 9 pm, we reached the office. Morning session consisted of mainly doing the layout for the E-commerce app in figma, i did a lot of pages from sign up to profile and checkout page. Figma is easy to use because of its user-friendly Figma is a great way to quickly design, build, and export files for animation and prototyping. It’s easy to use and has all the tools I need to get the job done.The mobile app live preview is a really nice touch. It helps me manage the quality and nuance of what I’m designing. I also learned about The 60-30-10 rule from the book, which says that 60% is your dominant hue, 30% is secondary color and 10% is for accent color.This rule helps you create a proper and well-balanced color application for your design. The idea here is simply dedicating the 60% of the palette to one color (usually, it’s a neutral color), another (complementary) color makes up 30% of the palette, and a third color (accent) is used for the remaining 10% of the design.This works because it helps to create a sense of balance and allows the eye to move comfortably from one focal point to the next. 

Then the afternoon session continued with the logical preposition where we did implications. From what we did yesterday using the AND, OR, NOT we built truth tables for some statements p and q. For AND, If p and q are true then p ^ q is true otherwise p ^ q is false.

For OR,  If p and q are false then p V q is false, otherwise p V q is true.

For NOT,  If p is true then ~p is false and if p is false then ~p is true.

Also we were taught about logical biconditional implications p←→q, 

A biconditional statement is a combination of a conditional statement and its converse, which leads to the if and only if form. For eg:

Consider the following two statements:

    I wear a hat if it’s sunny.

    I wear a hat only if it’s sunny.

These two statements sound so similar...but their meanings are different. If

I wear a hat if it’s sunny.

Another way to put it:

If it’s sunny, then I wear a hat.

If it’s sunny, it guarantees that I wear a hat! It doesn’t matter if I’m sick, or sleeping inside all day—according to the truth of this statement, a sunny day is sufficient to know that I wear a hat. Or, on 100% of sunny days, I wear a hat.

 an “only if” statement:

I wear a hat only if it’s sunny.

If this is true, then it means that if it’s a sunny day, I could wear a hat...but there’s no guarantee! However, we do know that if I’m wearing a hat, then it must be sunny.

Then we were given homework based on what we learned. 

The evening session was the continuation of the html basics, yesterday we were introduced to html basic and css. We tried making a login page from what we learned, today we were introduced to div tag in html. The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute. Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 

Used the div tag to create a rectangular section inside which we put text then we also learned to create a div inside of another div.
