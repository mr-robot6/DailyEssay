Today was the first day of the second week of our internship, i reached the office by 9 and started practicing on the health assistant app that i thought off, i had already made paper sketches of the initial layout of the app, so i tried to make that off figma from scratch, by doing this i learned the basics of figma, how to make frame and create prototype components and to test it out. Later my mentor approached and asked to talk to the rest of the employees like Jathin, the head of the security at Surfboard Payments. So i asked Jathin about what he does for the company and he explained about the security part in layman's terms. So basically, there are several types of security, like Operation security, Operational security (OPSEC), also known as procedural security, is a risk management process that encourages managers to view operations from the perspective of an adversary in order to protect sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. Then comes application security which is the process of developing, adding, and testing security features within applications to prevent security vulnerabilities against threats such as unauthorized access and modification. I also came to know of the difference between compliance and security, Security officers follow industry best practices to secure IT systems, especially at the organizational or enterprise level. Security pros are constantly looking at how to both:Prevent attackers from harming the company app  and user data Mitigate the amount of damage that is done when an attack is successful while Compliance studies a company’s security processes. It details their security at a single moment in time and compares it to a specific set of regulatory requirements. These requirements come in the form of legislation, industry regulations, or standards created from best practices.

Then i went to Mr Kingston, who is a quality analyst for surfboard,  quality assurance  1. Is a way of preventing mistakes in developed applications and avoiding problems when delivering them to users 2. Is a part of the app development process focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled 3. Is responsible for client/users’ training, setting standards, reviewing quality and selecting tools. A quality analyst tries to make scenarios where the app might fail , and if it does note it down in notion. There are also 3 types of testing techniques, white box testing, White box testing is testing the software at the structural level, verifying the internal workings of the software and the integration of various components of the software. White box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and the system levels of software testing processes. Then there is black box testing, which is testing your software by emulating the end user. This testing technique assumes that the tester is the end-user of the application and tests the interface without being concerned about the internals of the software that is being tested, and finally there is grey box testing, which is performing black box testing while having access to the source code of the software to ensure that informed tests can be run to determine boundary values and errors. Grey box testing implements intelligent test scenarios that are based on access to both source code and the user interface.

After that we had a class on problem solving where we were introduced to different types of problems like the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, where there are a few pieces of islands connected by 7 bridges and you have to cross every bridge but can only cross one bridge once. This was an example of a problem which has no solution, this problem is where the Euler equation was formed. This solution was only possible if we add or remove a bridge. He further added to check whether a problem will have a solution first before going all in to solve it. This knowledge to know whether a problem has got a solution comes from practice and experience. The next session we were introduced to .md files or Markdown files, which is a type of file extension used in vim to enable text formatting, instead of using .txt files if we use .md, we could use different commands for different types of text formatting like creating a heading using'#' before the sentence, '##' for sub heading and '**word**' for bold and '*word*' for italics also'1'. word for numbered list and  '-' word for bulleting list, this can be used for writing the daily essay.
