Today there was only one session where Ernest took over the class, introducing and explaining about UI/UX and wireframes. UX design refers to the term “user experience design”, while UI stands for “user interface design”. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different aspects of the product development process and the design discipline.

User experience design is a human-first way of designing products. User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products. The “user experience” part refers to the interaction between the user and a product or service. User experience design, then, considers all the different elements that shape this experience.

A UX designer thinks about how the experience makes the user feel, and how easy it is for the user to accomplish their desired tasks. They also observe and conduct task analyses to see how users actually complete tasks in a user flow.

For example: How easy is the checkout process when shopping online? Does your online banking app make it easy for you to manage your money?.

The ultimate purpose of UX design is to create easy, efficient, relevant, and all-round pleasant experiences for the user.

User interface design is the complement of user experience, which is a collection of tasks aimed at optimizing a product for successful and joyful usage. It includes the look and feel, presentation, and interactivity of a product.

In relation to websites and apps, UI design considers the look, feel, and interactivity of the product. It’s all about making sure that the user interface of a product is as intuitive as possible, and that means carefully considering each and every visual, interactive element the user might encounter.

A UI designer will think about icons and buttons, typography and color schemes, spacing, imagery, and responsive design.Like user experience design, user interface design is a multi-faceted and challenging role. It is responsible for the transference of a product’s development, research, content and layout into an attractive, guiding and responsive experience for users.

Wireframing in UI/UI Design is one of the most crucial steps which involves visualizing the skeleton of digital applications. A wireframe is a layout of a product that demonstrates what interface elements will exist on key pages. It is a critical part of the interaction design process.

A wireframe is generally a monochromatic drawing that’s created in the design phase of the Design Thinking Process. It provides a blueprint of the page structure, layout, information and functions. This in turn gives a clear idea to the stakeholders about the functioning and visual representation of application UI.

I also learned some more about dart programming. 

Class → Dart is an object-oriented language. It supports object-oriented programming features like classes, interfaces, etc. A class in terms of OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data for the object. Dart gives built-in support for this concept called class.

The class keyword is followed by the class name. The rules for identifiers must be considered while naming a class.


Creating an instance of a class → To create an instance of the class, use the new keyword followed by the class name.

Constructors → A constructor is a special function of the class that is responsible for initializing the variables of the class. Dart defines a constructor with the same name as that of the class. A constructor is a function and hence can be parameterized. However, unlike a function, constructors cannot have a return type. If you don’t declare a constructor, a default no-argument constructor is provided for you.

I also learned about Enumeration in dart, so enumerations or enum for short are named list of related items. An enumeration is used for defining named constant values. An enumerated type is declared using the enum keyword.

The enum is the keyword used to initialize enumerated data types.
