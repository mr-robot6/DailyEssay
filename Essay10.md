say- day 13

Today was a busy day, i finally decided to redesign the entire app, i thought about doing this but i never thought i'll do it now, I completed the first prototype so fast that i didn't think about some fundamental designing elements that should be followed while designing an app, it came to me after Mr Arul reviewed my design, he introduced the concept of the 30-60-10 rule Your main colour is 60%, your secondary colour is 30%, and your accent colour is 10%.

This rule will assist you in creating a well-balanced colour scheme for your design. The goal is to devote 60% of the palette to one hue (typically a neutral), 30% to another colour (complimentary), and 10% to a third colour (accent).

This works because it creates a sense of equilibrium and allows the eye to shift from one focal point to the next with ease. It is, by the way, really straightforward to use. He also taught me some spacing basics, the article he told me to read was called spacing friendships. 

Spacing is one part of designing that we might not look into it fully but it is so core that it may be the final thing that decides how your app looks, When you improve your spacing, the following happens:

    It is easier for users to consume the content.

    It creates a hierarchy of information that relays importance to the user.

    It creates consistency throughout your designs.

    It just looks better.

It included a lot of details about different rules one can follow to achieve good spacing, like the 8pt grid, The 8pt grid allows you to use multiples of 8 to space elements in your design. These units include 0, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. Spacing friendships is simply linking spaces with personal relations to make it easy to remember. Think of the distance between elements in your design as friendship circles. Some are closer; some are less so. The more familiar the two aspects are, the closer they are together. Conversely, the less friendly they are, the further apart. 

Now, returning to my app, I'm also working on a seller app, and Sankar asked how I'm going to keep track of inventory and what I'll do if someone adds something inappropriate or in the incorrect place; this is where I'll need an admin area where I can grant permission after an inventory is updated. I realised that I have to build a separate or include an admin dashboard into my app. 

Aside from that, we had our first session with Abraham Anna today, where he spoke about data. The various sorts of data and how a computer perceives each type of data. He spoke for a while and provided us many examples to assist us understand how a computer intercepts the information we provide. The fundamental concept he intended to convey to us was that all information and data is turned into bits of 0s and 1s, which are then converted into a series of electrical signals that a computer can understand. The most important thing he wanted to accomplish was to dispel a common misperception among interns. That is, a programme or programming language is created for humans, not for computers. We were all under the notion that a programme was developed to be understood by the computer. However, he made it plain that the computer only recognises 0s and 1s. So a programme is written the way it is currently so that another human looking at the code may understand why it is written the way it is. It was undoubtedly a fascinating and eye-opening seminar.
