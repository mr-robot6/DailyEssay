#  day 8 of internship.

The first session was solely learning html basics, continuing from yesterday's class, we learned in depth about different tags like div tag and span tag. Using border radius = to half the width of the div we can make circles, we learned about class and id, The class attribute is used to specify one or more class names for an HTML element. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element. The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for elements with the specified class name; 

<p class="name">

Difference between id and class attribute: The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements, also while using id we start with #. 

Then I learned about Margins and padding, a margin is the space around an element’s border, while padding is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element. 

A task was given as homework, where we have to link an external css file to the current html file. 

Then I learned the basics of using flutter, the difference between stateless and stateful widget, the state of the widget is the data of the objects that its properties (parameters) are sustaining at the time of its creation (when the widget is painted on the screen). The state can also change when it is used. 

Stateless Widget: The widgets whose state can not be altered once they are built are called stateless widgets. These widgets are immutable once they are built i.e any amount of change in the variables, icons, buttons, or retrieving data can not change the state of the app.

Stateful Widgets: The widgets whose state can be altered once they are built are called stateful Widgets. These states are mutable and can be changed multiple times in their lifetime. This simply means the state of an app can change multiple times with different sets of variables, inputs, data. Below is the basic structure of a stateful widget. Stateful widget overrides the createState() and returns a State. It is used when the UI can change dynamically.

The last session was an introduction into algorithms, algorithms are a sequence of steps or procedures required to complete a task. Thinking about or writing down the algorithms before coding or doing the task is necessary because a stepwise representation of a solution to a given problem, makes it easy to understand and uses a definite procedure. The session ended with a group task, where each group had to perform a unique task and before that note down the algorithms necessary for performing the task.
